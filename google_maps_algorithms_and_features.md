## Key Local SEO Ranking Factors for 2025 (from Uberall):

**1. Google Business Profile (GBP):**
*   **Most significant ranking factor.** Encompasses all information within your GBP (NAP data, images, Google posts).
*   **Maximizing effectiveness:** Ensure GBP is complete and accurate, engage with customers by responding to reviews, regularly update your profile, integrate direct links to your website, and choose appropriate categories, attributes, and services.
*   **Attributes as a New Ranking Factor:** Predefined and custom services now significantly impact visibility. Businesses should optimize their GBP by ensuring all predefined services are selected and fully described. For highly competitive searches, menu items and menu highlights (for restaurants) should match exact search queries.
*   **Services as a New Ranking Factor:** Google is introducing new predefined and custom services that can positively affect ranking. Highlighting these services (with emojis) can further enhance visibility and appeal.

**2. On-Page Optimization:**
*   Crucial for local SEO, emphasizing high-quality, relevant website content.
*   Includes optimizing title tags, meta descriptions, headers, and images with relevant local keywords.
*   Ensuring fast loading times and mobile-friendliness.
*   Optimizing core pages and location landing pages with detailed information about services and unique selling points.

**3. Online Reviews:**
*   Honest customer reviews across platforms (Google, Yelp, Trustpilot) significantly impact local search engine rankings.
*   Responding to both positive and negative reviews shows engagement and enhances reputation.
*   Encouraging satisfied customers to leave genuine feedback improves overall review profile and local SEO performance.

*   Focus on both internal and external link strategies to boost website authority.

**5. User Behavior:**
*   Engaging content with a positive user experience is essential for maintaining a strong ranking.
*   Behavioral signals like click-through rate, bounce rate, and time spent on a webpage are crucial.
*   Optimize site for quick loading, easy navigation, and meeting user needs.
*   Googleâ€™s local ranking algorithm places greater emphasis on user engagement signals in 2025:
    *   Peak-time traffic now influences rankings.
    *   Reviews, video content, and interactions with Google Posts increase time spent on a profile, signaling quality and relevance.
*   **Action Item:** Regularly post Google Updates, add new images and videos, and encourage customer interactions on GBP.

**6. Citations:**
*   Accurate citations (consistent business name, address, and phone number across all platforms) remain fundamental for local SEO, despite declining importance.
*   Regularly update information to avoid discrepancies.
*   Listings management tools can streamline and automate the process.

**7. Personalization:**
